2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk25_clk_wiz_0 and clk25_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk25_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk25_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk25_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk25_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk25_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk25_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT n_0_58_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin GEN_UART/op1_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin GEN_UART/op2_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin GEN_UART/op3_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch GEN_UART/o_RX_DVA_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin GEN_UART/o_RX_DVA_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
